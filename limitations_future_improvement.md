**Limitations & Future Improvement**


1. **Analysis limited to single station**. We could bring in more stations' data and find patterns and discover insights related to neighborhood demographics, distance to key destinations, accessibility, and ultimately what variables drive a station's traffic and their value for ads. Then we can answer the question: Are we missing any stations that have high ad ROI potential?

2. **4-year timeframe may not capture longer cyclical patterns**. 4 years can be representative, but COVID has impacted at least 25% of our data, meaning if we really want to forecast, let's say the trend in 10 years, we might need more data.

3. **Analysis limited to descriptive analysis**. We could train a model to forecast station performance. In addition, we can find the feature importance to determine which factors of the station are shaping the performance. For example, does an elevator increase the traffic? Does having a cross-platform design positively impact the performance (that means you can reach the southbound platform if you enter through the northbound entry)?

4. **No direct measurement of advertising effectiveness/conversion**. This has always been a challenge in the ads industry. There isn't any effective knowledge to really understand how many eyeballs see ads and what the ROI is, unless there's a QR code to scan. That's why I believe turnstile ads are interesting because unlike ads on the wall, people have to get through turnstiles, which could give more confidence in the ad exposure. We should also conduct surveys at the station to interview passengers if they remember the ads on the turnstile they just passed through a few seconds ago.
