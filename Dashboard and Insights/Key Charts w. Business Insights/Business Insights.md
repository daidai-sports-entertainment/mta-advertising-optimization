### What the data shows**
1. In 2020, COVID has negatively impacted the station and resulted in ~57% in total traffic.
2. Post-COVID, the station has been steadily recovering and showed ~23% and ~15% annual increase in total traffic in 2021 and 2022, respectively.
3. The exit vs entry ratio has increased in 2021 and 2022, implying 77th Street has become more of a departure hub, with passengers exiting here to reach final destinations (later findings support this trend)

### Strategic Recommendation:**
1. Capitalize on Market Recovery Momentum:
  a. Invest now during growth phase. 77th Street shows 23% and 15% annual traffic increases, indicating expanding audience reach
  b. Secure long-term contracts at current rates before MTA adjusts pricing to reflect recovery success
2. Focus advertising content on departure-oriented messaging since 77th Street has become an exit hub. Targeting commuters transitioning to leisure activities such as dining, entertainment, shopping, and home-bound services.

### Implementation Example**

* For dating brands like Bumble, the message could pertain to "Your workday is done - time for that dinner date you've been planning. Discover great spots near you for tonight."

* For food delivery brands like Uber Eats, the message could pertain to "Skip the cooking after a long day - your favorite dinner is just a tap away before you get home."

* For legal services brands like personal injury firms, the message could pertain to "Get home safe. If the unexpected happens on your commute, we're here to protect you."

* For retail brands like Target, the message could pertain to "One quick stop on your way home - grab what you need for tonight's dinner or tomorrow's meeting."

* For fitness brands like Equinox, the message could pertain to "End your workday with energy, not exhaustion. Your evening workout awaits just around the corner."

### What the Data Shows:

1. Winter appears to outperform other seasons (29% entries, 27% exits), but this is primarily driven by COVID-year anomalies in 2020 data.
2. When normalized for COVID impact, 77th Street demonstrates remarkable seasonal consistency across all periods.
3. Seasonal distribution remains balanced (23-29% range) rather than showing extreme seasonal volatility typical of tourist or weather-dependent stations.
4. The entry/exit ratio stays consistent across seasons, indicating stable commuter patterns year-round.
5. Monthly analysis excluding 2020 COVID data reveals December and October as peak months, with January, May, and March maintaining strong consistent performance.

### Strategic Recommendations:

1. Leverage Seasonal Stability to Secure Annual Contracts:
  a. Invest in 77th Street for consistent audience delivery regardless of season
  b. Lock in annual contracts to guarantee stable impression delivery across all campaign periods with confidence
2. Optimize Peak Month Campaigns:
  a. Focus major campaign launches in December and October (highest traffic months excluding COVID year)
 
### Implementation Example**
* For fitness brands like SoulCycle, this means instead of fighting competitors for crowded New Year's resolution advertising space, they should capture fitness-minded commuters months earlier during stable high-traffic periods like October and December before January.
