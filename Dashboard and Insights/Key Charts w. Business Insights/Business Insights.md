![COVID Recovery Chart](chart-screenshots/covid_recovery_chart.png)

### What the data shows
1. In 2020, COVID has negatively impacted the station and resulted in ~57% in total traffic.
2. Post-COVID, the station has been steadily recovering and showed ~23% and ~15% annual increase in total traffic in 2021 and 2022, respectively.
3. The exit vs entry ratio has increased in 2021 and 2022, implying 77th Street has become more of a departure hub, with passengers exiting here to reach final destinations (later findings support this trend)

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Strategic Recommendation
1. Capitalize on Market Recovery Momentum:
  + Invest now during growth phase. 77th Street shows 23% and 15% annual traffic increases, indicating expanding audience reach
  + Secure long-term contracts at current rates before MTA adjusts pricing to reflect recovery success
2. Focus advertising content on departure-oriented messaging since 77th Street has become an exit hub. Targeting commuters transitioning to leisure activities such as dining, entertainment, shopping, and home-bound services.

### üí° Implementation Example

* For dating brands like Bumble, the message could pertain to "Your workday is done - time for that dinner date you've been planning. Discover great spots near you for tonight."

* For food delivery brands like Uber Eats, the message could pertain to "Skip the cooking after a long day - your favorite dinner is just a tap away before you get home."

* For legal services brands like personal injury firms, the message could pertain to "Get home safe. If the unexpected happens on your commute, we're here to protect you."

* For retail brands like Target, the message could pertain to "One quick stop on your way home - grab what you need for tonight's dinner or tomorrow's meeting."

* For fitness brands like Equinox, the message could pertain to "End your workday with energy, not exhaustion. Your evening workout awaits just around the corner."

</div>

### What the Data Shows
1. Winter appears to outperform other seasons (29% entries, 27% exits), but this is primarily driven by COVID-year anomalies in 2020 data.
2. When normalized for COVID impact, 77th Street demonstrates remarkable seasonal consistency across all periods, with Fall and Spring moderately outperformed others.
3. Seasonal distribution remains balanced (23-29% range) rather than showing extreme seasonal volatility typical of tourist or weather-dependent stations.
4. The entry/exit ratio stays consistent across seasons, indicating stable commuter patterns year-round.
5. Monthly analysis excluding 2020 COVID data reveals October and November as peak months, with September, May, and December maintaining strong consistent performance.

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Strategic Recommendation
1. Leverage Seasonal Stability to Secure Annual Contracts:
  + Invest in 77th Street for consistent audience delivery regardless of season
  + Lock in annual contracts to guarantee stable impression delivery across all campaign periods with confidence
2. Optimize Peak Month Campaigns:
  + Focus major campaign launches in October and November (highest traffic months excluding COVID year)

### üí° Implementation Example
* For fitness brands like SoulCycle, this means instead of fighting competitors for crowded New Year's resolution advertising space, they should capture fitness-minded commuters months earlier during stable high-traffic periods like October and November, before January comes.

### What the data shows
1. 2019 Pre-COVID: Friday 5 PM dominated with 3.03 rush hour ratio, followed by Thursday and Wednesday 5 PM (2.96, 2.95 ratios)
2. 2020 COVID Disruption: Completely altered patterns with Saturday 1 AM (2.88 ratio) and midday hours replacing traditional rush periods
3. 2021-2022 Recovery: Rush hour patterns returned to pre-pandemic levels, with 2022 showing Friday 5 PM at 3.07 ratio - exceeding 2019 baseline
4. Consistent Evening Focus: Across all non-COVID years, 5 PM (hour 17) dominates the top rush hour slots, confirming departure-heavy traffic flow

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Strategic Recommendation
1. Choose Evening-Optimized Content Strategy:
  + Design ad content that works best during 5 PM peak hours when 3x more people will see your message

  + Use complete market recovery data to justify increased investment in this location over competitors

  + Create content for regular, high-income commuters with predictable spending patterns and consistent daily routines

* For financial services brands like Fidelity, the message could pertain to "Reflecting on your future during your commute home? Take the next step toward your financial goals."
* For entertainment brands like AMC Theatre, the message could pertain to "Your workday is done - make tonight special. Catch the 7 PM Guardians of the Galaxy vol.4 instead of heading straight home."

### What the data shows
1. Northbound Premium Turnstiles: t-01-03-02 and t-01-00-00 dominate traffic volume with 1.2M+ total traffic, significantly outperforming all other locations
2. Southbound Top Performers: t-00-00-00, t-00-00-01, t-00-00-07, and t-00-00-06 show strong consistent performance across all seasons
3. Traffic Concentration: Top 6 turnstiles (3 Northbound, 3 Southbound) generate approximately 60-70% of total station traffic
4. Directional Balance: 50.7% Northbound vs 49.3% Southbound traffic distribution shows balanced flow with slight northbound preference
5. Consistent Seasonal Performance: Top-performing turnstiles maintain their rankings across all seasons, indicating reliable premium inventory

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Strategic Recommendation
1. Focus Budget on Premium Turnstile Locations:
  + Concentrate advertising spend on identified top-performing turnstiles for maximum impression delivery
  + Secure exclusive placement on t-01-03-02 and t-01-00-00 (Northbound) for highest traffic exposure
2. Budget-Conscious Brand Strategy:
  + For smaller brands with limited budgets, secure contracts exclusively on the top 2-3 highest-performing turnstiles rather than spreading across multiple locations
  + Maximize ROI by investing in guaranteed high-traffic locations instead of diluting spend across average-performing turnstiles
3. Premium Content Strategy for Top Turnstiles:
  + Create special, eye-catching designs exclusively for highest-traffic turnstiles to capitalize on additional eyeballs
  + Develop premium messaging or visuals for top-performing locations while using standard content for lower-traffic turnstiles
    
### üí° Implementation Example
* For dating apps like Bumble, the message on the 2 or 3 top turnstile could be something like "averagely, we make 2 out 11 matches convert to a date", and the design of those two turnstile should stand out visually (with additional heart icon maybe?)
* For marketplace brands like eBay, the message on the top 1 or 2 turnstiles could be something like "looking for special collectives? there are more, only on Ebay", meanwhile having exceptional design of ads on these turnstile to represent "hidden gem"
* For business services like Yelp, the message could be something like "8 out of 10 customers return after leaving a review on Yelp. Is your business on Yelp yet?", and make the design on these two turnstiles different

![COVID Recovery Chart](chart-screenshots/top_turnstile_focus.png)

### What the data shows
1. Individual Turnstile Variations: Despite overall exit-dominance, turnstiles t-00-00-07, t-00-00-01, t-00-00-06, and t-00-00-00 show entry-heavy patterns (ratios above 150-300)
2. Strategic Placement Opportunities: Entry-heavy turnstiles capture arriving passengers while exit-heavy turnstiles target departing commuters
3. Consistent Patterns: Individual turnstile flow characteristics remain stable across different days, enabling reliable ad placement strategies

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Strategic Recommendation
1. Directional Ad Placement Strategy:
  + Place arrival-focused ads on entry-heavy turnstiles (t-00-00-07, t-00-00-01) targeting incoming passengers
  + Position departure-focused messaging on exit-heavy turnstiles targeting outbound commuters
2. Optimize Physical Ad Positioning:
  + Face ads toward entry side of high-entry turnstiles to catch arriving passengers' attention
  + Orient messaging toward exit side of departure-heavy turnstiles for maximum departing passenger exposure
