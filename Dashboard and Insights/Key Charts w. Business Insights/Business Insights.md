**What the data shows**

2. Post-COVID, the station has been steadily recovering and showed ~23% and ~15% annual increase in total traffic in 2021 and 2022, respectively.
3. The exit vs entry ratio has increased in 2021 and 2022, implying 77th Street has become more of a departure hub, with passengers exiting here to reach final destinations (later findings support this trend)

**Strategic Recommendation:**
1. Capitalize on Market Recovery Momentum:
  a. Invest now during growth phase. 77th Street shows 23% and 15% annual traffic increases, indicating expanding audience reach
  b. Secure long-term contracts at current rates before MTA adjusts pricing to reflect recovery success
2. Focus advertising content on departure-oriented messaging since 77th Street has become an exit hub. Targeting commuters transitioning to leisure activities such as dining, entertainment, shopping, and home-bound services.
