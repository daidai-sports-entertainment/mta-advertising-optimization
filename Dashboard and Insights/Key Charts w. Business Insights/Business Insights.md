2. When normalized for COVID impact, 77th Street demonstrates remarkable seasonal consistency across all periods, with Fall and Spring moderately outperformed others.
3. Seasonal distribution remains balanced (23-29% range) rather than showing extreme seasonal volatility typical of tourist or weather-dependent stations.
4. The entry/exit ratio stays consistent across seasons, indicating stable commuter patterns year-round.
